## Airlines
Airlines is an application created using React to display airline routes using sample data.

The list of routes can be updated using the dropdowns and will
filter based on the selection of airport and/or airline.

Numbers listed next to airports and airlines in the dropdowns indicate the amount of mathcing routes under that designation.

The map component displays connected routes by airport location.
